## About
A Chaos Space Marine, also sometimes called a Traitor Marine, a Renegade Marine, or a Heretic Astartes, is a former Loyalist Space Marine of the Imperium of Man who has chosen to abandon the service of the Emperor of Mankind and dedicate himself to the service of Chaos to achieve his own ends. Such corrupt Astartes normally belong to one of the nine original Traitor Legions that betrayed the Emperor during the ancient civil war called the Horus Heresy more than 10,000 standard years ago, while others come from Space Marine Chapters created long after the Heresy ended that have turned Renegade. Chaos can corrupt Astartes of any time and place just as its siren call leads many lesser men to their damnation.
